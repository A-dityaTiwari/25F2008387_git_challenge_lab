            <p class="intro-text">
                I am a technology-focused learner and builder with a strong inclination toward artificial intelligence,
                data science, and software development. I believe in understanding systems from first principles and
                using that understanding to create reliable, efficient, and future-ready solutions.

            <article class="philosophy-content">
                <p>
                    I approach technology as both an engineering discipline and a problem-solving craft.
                    Rather than chasing trends blindly, I focus on building strong fundamentals, validating ideas
                    through experimentation, and learning continuously from both successes and failures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is not just to write code, but to design systems that scale well, remain maintainable,
                    and deliver meaningful impact in real-world contexts.

            <article class="journey-content">
                <p>
                    My journey began with core programming concepts and logical thinking, gradually expanding into
                    data structures, algorithms, and system-level understanding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over time, I transitioned into data-centric domains, exploring how data can be transformed into
                    insights, predictions, and intelligent decision-making systems through machine learning and AI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, I focus on applying this knowledge through hands-on projects, continuous upskilling,
                    and deliberate practice to prepare for advanced technical roles and research-driven opportunities.

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
                    and software architecture while working on projects that sit at the intersection of research
                    and real-world application.
